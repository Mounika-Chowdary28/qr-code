🌍 Project Description – Smart Waste Management System

This project is a MERN stack application designed to digitize and optimize the waste collection process. It connects users, transporters, recyclers, and admins in one system to make waste disposal transparent, trackable, and efficient.

At its core, the system uses QR codes for user waste disposal validation and real-time transporter tracking to ensure accountability and efficiency.

🔑 Key Roles

User

Each user generates a QR code that represents their waste bin/household.

When a transporter collects waste, they scan the user’s QR code.

Transporter

Responsible for collecting waste from users.

Each scan event stores the transporter’s location checkpoint.

At the end of the day, all checkpoints form a path (visualized on a map) to track their collection journey.

This path helps admins monitor transporter activity and efficiency.

Recycler

Receives waste from transporters.

Marks the type/weight of waste collected for recycling.

Admin

Manages all entities (users, transporters, recyclers).

Tracks daily activity of transporters through their collection paths.

Generates reports (waste collected per day, transporter efficiency, recycling stats).

🚦 Project Flow
1. User → QR Code

Each user has a unique QR code.

This QR code is scanned by transporters during waste pickup.

2. Transporter → Scanning Event

When a transporter scans the user’s QR:

The system captures the transporter ID.

Current GPS location is stored as a checkpoint in that transporter’s daily history.

A record of collection is created for that user (but user details don’t need to be stored in checkpoints).

3. Transporter → Daily Path Tracking

As a transporter continues scanning different users, multiple checkpoints are added.

These checkpoints form a path (sequence of locations) representing their waste collection route.

4. Recycler → Waste Handling

Once the transporter delivers waste to a recycler, a record is created about the waste type/quantity.

This helps monitor recycling efficiency.

5. Admin → Monitoring & Reports

Admin can view:

A map visualization of each transporter’s route for the day.

Number of checkpoints completed.

Time taken between checkpoints (efficiency).

Waste delivered to recyclers.

Admin can also generate daily/monthly reports.

📊 Example Daily Flow

Morning – Transporter starts route → first checkpoint stored.

During the day – Transporter scans multiple users’ QR codes → checkpoints keep getting added.

Evening – Transporter completes route and dumps waste at recycler.

System – Creates a daily history log of checkpoints.

Admin – Views transporter’s path on a map + total waste collected.

✅ Benefits of This Flow

Transparency – Admin knows exact routes transporters take.

Efficiency – Helps detect skipped households.

Automation – Users don’t need to manually report; QR + GPS does the job.

Data insights – Reports for optimization of routes & recycling.
